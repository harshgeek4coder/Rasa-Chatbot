  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: "The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[1] The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.[4] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 24 September 2020, more than 31.9 million cases have been reported in 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 978,000 deaths; more than 22 million people have recovered."

                 \ first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now\
                 \ spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person\
                 \ spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like\
                 \ measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19\
                 \ is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19\
                 \ can spread the illness to others. That is why we recommend that these patients\
                 \ be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they\
                 \ are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.\n\
                 How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release\
                 \ someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with\
                 \ doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials\
                 \ and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,\
                 \ illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.\n\
                 The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably\
                 \ in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community\
                 \ spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including\
                 \ some who are not sure how or where they became infected."



  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: "It is highly unlikely that people can contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the primary transmission route is through person-to- person contact and through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes."

  utter_corona_spread_warm:
  - text: "With the start of summer coming soon, many are hopeful that the warmer weather will slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. There have been hints from lab experiments that increased temperature and humidity may reduce the viability of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, other coronaviruses that cause less severe diseases, such as the common cold, do spread more slowly among people during the summer."

  utter_corona_spread_risk:
  - text: "COVID-19 is often more severe in people who are older than 60 years or who have health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their immune system.​
           If you’re at high risk, know what to do, and take the right actions now to protect yourself.If you’re not at high risk, do your part to prevent the spread of coronavirus to those who are.There is increasing evidence that people with existing chronic conditions or compromised immune systems due to disability are at higher risk of death due to COVID-19."
